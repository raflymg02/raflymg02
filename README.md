# Hi! I'm Rafly, a software engineer.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raflymg02/)

I have a strong foundation in software engineering, along with hands-on experience in machine learning and data processing.
I'm passionate about building technology that solves real-world problems and improves lives.
My bachelor's thesis is focused on educational technology, specifically in gamification, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive difficulty.

## More about me:
- I prefer backend, mostly by Go, but also work with C# and Python.
- I use C and C++ as well, but mostly outside of web development.
- Currently diving deeper into JavaScript, especially Node.js and Svelte.
- I have done some development using both Godot and Unity.

Feel free to contact me!
