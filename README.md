# Hi there 
I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics.
I have a strong foundation in software engineering, along with hands-on experience in machine learning and data processing.
I'm passionate about building technology that solves real-world problems and improves lives.

My bachelor's thesis is focused on educational technology, specifically in gamification, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive difficulty.

Interests:
- Personally use Go, C#, and Python,
- Currently diving deeper into JavaScript, especially Node.js and Svelte,
- Always eager to explore new tools, frameworks, and best practices.
